**Android ndk for Termux(only supports aarch64 and Android 9 or above)**

The source code from AOSP [llvm-toolchain](https://android.googlesource.com/toolchain/llvm-project), which is consistent with the official NDK version.

At first, we donâ€˜t need to rebuild the whole NDK, since google already built most of it.
so we only need to build the llvm toolchain, then replace the llvm inside NDK.

Building the `android-ndk`, please refer to [Android Clang/LLVM Toolchain Readme Doc](https://android.googlesource.com/toolchain/llvm_android/+/master/README.md)

Packaging and testing the `android-ndk`, please refer to [Ndk Toolchains Readme Doc](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/ndk/+/master/docs/Toolchains.md)

Building `android app` with termux-ndk, please refer to [build-app](https://github.com/Lzhiyong/termux-ndk/tree/master/build-app)
